Titanium Advanced Menu
======================
I was searching for a nice Twitter interface for the iPad, but never found a good solution. Saw a great video from Appcelerator (https://vimeo.com/40104956) but there was no source code at all. So trying to recreate it to use the menu and interface style.

I created a CommonJS module which will work on iPad and iPhone as well. Probably also on Android but not tested yet.
It is just possible to create several windows attached to the DataArray and send it to the CommonJS module to create this kind of interface.

Required
--------
- Coffeescript (JS Files are included as well)

Module
------
To use the module, there is some data needed. Not yet the easiest, but a good start.

Demo
